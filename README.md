# Rules Engine Pattern Demo
**C# / xUnit Demo of the Rules Engine Pattern**

This repo contains Visual Studio 2017 solution and project files that are meant to supplement the blog post [Rules Engine Demo](http://www.franksbrain.com).  It is the final, working version of the steps outlined in the blog.

This project uses C# (.net core), and xUnit for unit tests.
